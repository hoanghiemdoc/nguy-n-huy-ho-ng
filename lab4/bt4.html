<h1>The Cottage Garden</h1>

<p>
    the cottage garden is a distinct style of garden that uses informal design,
    dense plantings,and a mixture of ornamental and edible plants
</p>

<p>
    The Cottage Garden originated in <u>England</u> and its history
    can be traced back for centuries,although they were re-invented in 1870's
    English,when stylized versions were formed as a reaction to the more structured and rigorously
    maintained <u>English estate gardens</u>
</p>

<p>The earliest cottage gardens were more practical than their
modern descendants,with an emphasis on vegetables and herbs,along with some fruit trees</p>
